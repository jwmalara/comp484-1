                                    Author of the critically acclaimed best seller, The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme
                                    Court, Jeffrey Toobin brings the inside story of one of America's most mysterious and powerful
                                    institutions to the Saroyan stage. At the podium, Toobin is an unbiased, deeply analytic expert on
                                    American law, politics and procedure and he provides a unique look into the inner workings of
                                    the Supreme Court and its influence.
